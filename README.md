# Panic Attack Data Analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data related to panic attacks using Snowflake and Power BI. The workflow integrates cloud-based data warehousing with powerful visualization to uncover meaningful insights into trends, patterns, and distributions within the dataset.

The analysis process involved:

Creating and managing a data table in Snowflake.

Importing the dataset into Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

Designing interactive dashboards to enhance storytelling and improve the interpretability of findings.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

Snowflake â€“ Data storage, querying, and preparation.

Power BI â€“ Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

SQL â€“ Querying and preparing structured datasets.

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps in the Workflow

- Data Preparation in Snowflake

- Dataset loaded into Snowflake.

- Table creation and schema design for structured storage.

- SQL queries used for initial exploration and cleaning.

- Integration with Power BI

- Import of Snowflake dataset into Power BI.

- Additional cleaning and transformation applied (handling nulls, formatting, feature adjustments).

- Creation of calculated measures and relationships.

- Visualization & Insights

- Built interactive Power BI dashboards.

- Highlighted patterns, distributions, and correlations in panic attackâ€“related factors.

- Enhanced data storytelling for decision-making and interpretation.
